  <h1> Python Live Project </h1>
  <p> We're creating software designed to help hobbyists keep track of their collections of items <br/>
    as well as interact with APIs and use DataScraping to get up to date information on things <br/>
    related to those collections and hobbies. This project is built using Python, Django, SQLite,
    and HTML/CSS.</p>
